This ideal image is just a mean for each pixel across all the images . mean_cxrs = stacked_cxrs.mean(0) show_image(mean_cxrs) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d825b3610&gt; . mean_headct = stacked_heads.mean(0) show_image(mean_headct) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d825bbf50&gt; . now we can see how much example image differs from the ideals: . F.mse_loss(stacked_cxrs[0], mean_cxrs).sqrt() . tensor(0.2527) . F.mse_loss(stacked_cxrs[0], mean_headct).sqrt() . tensor(0.4144) . looks like that one was a CXR indeed - L2 loss between ideal image from CXR category (mean_cxrs) was lower . so let&#39;s build a simple classifier function, that predicts whether image is a headct or not . def is_headct(img_tensor): if F.mse_loss(img_tensor, mean_cxrs) &gt; F.mse_loss(img_tensor, mean_headct): return True else: return False . now we test the classifier . cxrs_preds = tensor([not is_headct(stacked_cxrs[i]) for i in range(stacked_cxrs.shape[0])]) cxrs_accuracy = cxrs_preds.sum().float() / cxrs_preds.shape[0] print(f&#39;Accuracy on CXRs: {round( (cxrs_accuracy).item() * 100, 2)}%&#39;) . Accuracy on CXRs: 99.15% . head_preds = tensor([is_headct(stacked_heads[i]) for i in range(stacked_heads.shape[0])]) head_accuracy = head_preds.sum().float() / head_preds.shape[0] print(f&#39;Accuracy on HeadCTs: {round( (head_accuracy).item() * 100, 2)}%&#39;) . Accuracy on HeadCTs: 100.0% . ... of course: . those classes were the most distinguishable from each other and | we didn&#39;t split into train and test sets here so results are biased (as each image we predict was used to figure out the &quot;ideal&quot; image) | but this was a nice start of this blog :) .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
